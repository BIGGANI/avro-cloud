#Avro Cloud

A distributed Avro transliteration service featuring auto-learning ability with anonymous crowd-sourced data.

###Why

1. Current Avro Phonetic was built keeping pre-internet age in mind. Users download it, use it offline and Avro gradually learns from user input (though that feature is in pretty rudimentary stage). Every installation here typically creates separate learning database. A cloud based solution could help to merge this huge resource so that everyone can get benefit from it.
2. Google and Microsoft started similar projects, but those data/service are not accessible by others. Google already deprecated its public API for the transliteration service.
3. Language continues to change, and it is not possible to define it with mere formal dictionaries. Croud sourcing can help overcome this problem.
4. Porting whole application logic to all possible platforms is simply a huge waste.
